        a huge commercial success like other artists from his time, he's widely remembered by almost every important artist (such as 
        The Beatles and Queen) as a huge inspiration. Until this day, is the only person include in both Rock and Jazz respective Halls of Fame.

    <h4>One of the most prolific bands from Canada, they got international recognition after mixing Hard Rock with Progressive Rock in the 70s.
    They inspired generations of artists, such as Metallica, Dream Theather and pretty much every serious drummer in the world. Despite a huge
    and excellent discography, Moving Pictures was the album that made them one of the most followed bands around the world.
